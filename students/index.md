  <h3>Want to become a Math a TA/Grader?</h3>
  
  <p>The math department is always looking for students with strong foundations in any math class, excellent communication skills, engagement with peers, and the ability to provide constructive feedback. If you are passionate about helping others succeed in math and enjoy working in a collaborative environment, we encourage you to apply!</p>
  <p>Start by visiting the Department information <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/undergraduate/math-ta-and-grader-jobs.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>If you want me to recommend you for a position, please consider the following guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Even if we did not interact closely in-person during the course, I will be happy to write a recommendation for you.</li>
    <li>The better your performance in the class, the stronger your recommendation will be.</li>
    <li>Reach out to me with at least <strong>two weeks</strong> in advance for me to submit a recommendation. Consider the application deadline and plan accordingly.</li>
	<li>Normally I will write a recommendation if you were a past student. For current students with less than 8 weeks in the semester, I might not be the best person to write this letter for you </li>
    <li>Feel free to ask questions about the position, your expected duties and how to succeed if it is your first time becoming a TA/grader.</li>
  </ul>
  -->
  <h3>Do you need a recommendation letter for School/Research/Transfer/Job applications?</h3>
  <p> The quality of the letter will depend on three aspects: Your course performance, your interactions with me and how far in 
  advance you request the letter. Consider the following guidelines. </p>
  <ul>
  <li> Send me an email **at least six weeks in-advance** from your application deadline with the request. Include the course you took with me, the purpose of the letter and deadlines.  </li>
  <li> Attach a copy of your academic transcript (unofficial is okay), your resume,  personal statement or any other relevant documentation. </li>
  <li> Enter correctly my email on your application portal. </li>
  <li> Requests under six weeks in advance might be considered, but the strength of the letter might not be what you would deserve. </li>
  </ul>

<div class="hidden-content" id="current">
<p> Read the syllabus of the course for a more accurate description of the course policies.  </p>
  <h3>Letter grades and Curving scores </h3>
  <p> Your grade letter is usually assigned according to the standard ranges according to your class final score: </p>
  <p> A (95–100), A- (90–94), B+ (87–89), B (83–86), B- (80–82), C+ (77–79), C (73–76), C- (70–72), D+ (67–69), D (63–66), D- (60-62). E (Below 60)</p>
  <p> Curving scores usually depends on course overall performance, and if a curve will be implemented, it will be communicated to you. Please refrain from asking about curving scores </p>
  <p> If a curve is implemented, it is usually by adjusting the cut-offs for the letter ranges using a piecewise linear function </p>
  <a href="resources/curve.html"> This tool </a> will help you to compute your adjusted score if using a piecewise linear function

<div class="hidden-content" id="projects">

<p>
  I offer undergraduate and graduate students various opportunities to get involved in mathematical topics beyond the scope of regular coursework of a typical major, or to get in-scope involvement in innovative teaching practices and techniques. These projects can serve as an introduction to mathematical research and education or potentially evolve into an Honors or graduate thesis.
