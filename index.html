      <p> I  am currently a full time PhD student at the <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/">University of Western Ontario</a>, under the supervision of Prof. Matthias Franz.
      My main area of research is the Equivariant cohomology; among my mathematical interests are Algebraic topology, group actions, symplectic geometry and homological algebra. 
       During Winter 2020 I am participating as a <i> Long Term Visitor </i> in the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/toric"> Thematic Program on Toric Topology </a> at the Fields Inistute in Toronto.
       I am passionate about teaching mathematics as well, and in my spare time I learn some coding and data science. I am also a part time guitar player and gamer.
      </p>
      <p> I am currently (Fall 2019) organizing the Mathematics Graduate Student Seminar at Western. Visit the  <a href="https://uwomathgrad.github.io/">websitet</a> to get more info about the seminar
