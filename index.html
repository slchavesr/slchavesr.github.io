      <p align="justify"> During Fall-2019, I was an  organizer for the Mathematics Graduate Student Seminar at Western. Visit the  <a href="https://uwomathgrad.github.io/">website</a> to get more info about the seminar.
      I participated in <a href="https://brainhackwestern.github.io/">Brainhack Western 2019</a> relating mathematics and neuroscience; wining an innovative award for our proposed <a href="/docs/brainwave.pdf"> project </a> on <i>How does the brain sound</i>.

      <p align="justify"> I  obtained my Ph.D in mathematics from the <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/">University of Western Ontario</a> in July 2020 under the supervision of Matthias Franz.
      My main area of research is the study of syzygies in equivariant cohomology. Among my mathematical interests are algebraic topology, transformation groups, symplectic geometry and homological algebra.

       <p align="justify"> Currently, I am a student teaching Fellow at the Department of Mathematics at Western supporting the implementation of <a href="https://webwork.maa.org/">WeBWork</a> for the migration to online teaching.</p>

      <p align="justify"> From January to June 2020, I was a  <i> Long Term Visitor </i> in the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/toric"> Thematic Program on Toric Topology </a> at the Fields Inistute in Toronto.
       I am passionate about teaching mathematics as well, and in my spare time I learn some open source coding, play guitar and some videogames.
