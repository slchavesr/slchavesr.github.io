I am currently working on the <b> equivariant cohomology for 2-torus actions </b>, which is the main topic of my PhD dissertation. I related the classical topological construction of the equivariant cohomology from a purely algebraic point of view.
This is why my research is also devoted to group cohomology and  modules over polynomial rings. Here below can be found some manuscripts that I have writteng during my career.
