      <p> I  am currently a full time PhD student at the <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/">University of Western Ontario</a>, under the supervision of Prof. Matthias Franz.
      My main area of research is the Equivariant cohomology; among my mathematical interests are Algebraic topology, group actions, symplectic geometry and homological algebra. 
       I am passionate about teaching mathematics as well, and in my spare time I learn some coding and data science. I am also a part time guitar player and gamer.
      </p>
      <p> I am currently (Fall 2019) organizing the Mathematics Graduate Student Seminar at Western. Visit the  <a href="https://uwomathgrad.github.io/">websitet</a> to get more info about the seminar
