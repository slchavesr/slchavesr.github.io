**Last Teaching Experience**

I was Teaching Fellow in Summer-2020 supporting the implementation of [WeBWork](https://webwork.maa.org/) at Western and authoring problems for Logic, Set Theory and Combinatorics.

I completed the [Western Certificate in University Teaching and Learning](https://teaching.uwo.ca/programs/certificates/cutl.html) on Feb 2020. 

For previous courses that I have taught, refer to my [CV](https://slchavesr.github.io/Sergio%20Chaves%20-%20CV.pdf).

For my Teaching Philosophy statement and a detailed statement of my teaching experience, professional development and reflections on mathematical teaching, visit my [Teaching Dossier](teaching_dossier.md).
