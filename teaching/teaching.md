On Fall 2019 I am a teaching assistant for [Math 1600](https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/riley/fall2019/index.html) Linear Algebra and [Math 3124](https://owl.uwo.ca/access/content/group/70fc07a1-3d95-4958-9685-d21dfc05b684/outline.pdf) Complex Analysis.

I am pursuing the [Western Certificate in University Teaching and Learning](https://teaching.uwo.ca/programs/certificates/cutl.html).
