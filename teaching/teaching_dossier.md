# 1. Brief Biography <a name="briefbiography"></a>

<p style="text-align: justify"> 
Teaching has always been a driving force behind my academic journey. After completing my Master's degree in Mathematics in 2013, I seized the opportunity to instruct introductory courses in Mathematics, which ignited my passion for teaching and inspired me to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario in 2015. Throughout my doctoral studies, I continued to expand my teaching experience by working as a teaching assistant for a diverse range of courses and actively contributing to the support of undergraduate while widening my teaching and professional portafolio. Since 2021, I've been a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester, where I've had the privilege of teaching a variety of courses, including higher level courses. My passion for teaching is evident throughout this dossier, and I am committed to fostering the learning process of my students as I continue to advance in my academic career.






</p>

# 2. Teaching Philosophy <a name="teachingphilosphy"></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
"What is mathematics?" is a question I always begin my undergraduate first-day class with. While some students may hold positive perceptions of mathematics, biases, negative images, and misconceptions remain common among undergraduates. These misconceptions include beliefs such as "Mathematics is a hard, challenging, and boring subject", "It is solely about finding and using formulas", "It's just a required course for my program", or "It's only about solving problems."


</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
My teaching philosophy is rooted in raising awareness about the importance of mathematics, highlighting the valuable skills acquired through its study, and dispelling stereotypes and misconceptions. My approach centers on inspiring and motivating students to engage in activities such as estimation, verification, interpretation, articulation of results, and the ability to connect with others' ideas. These principles form the foundation of my teaching career. Moreover, sharing my passion for the subject and witnessing the transformation of students' answers to the question "What is mathematics?" into more positive perspectives has shaped me into the educator I am today.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
I view teaching as a comprehensive process that extends well beyond the confines of the classroom. It encompasses a spectrum of elements, including preparation, practical experience, motivation, and a guiding educational philosophy. These factors collectively shape a student's perspective on the subject matter, both within and outside the classroom. In my perspective, teaching represents a crucial phase in the journey of learning and character development, one that should be adapted to align with the current advantages and requirements of the contemporary world.

## Universidad Central de Colombia: Instructor (2013) <a name="ucentral"> </a>


<p style="text-align: justify">
    
During 2013 I served as an instructor at the <a href="https://www.ucentral.edu.co/"> Universidad Central de Colombia </a> in the department of
engineering and mathematics. My responsibilites were tailored  around working professionals studying during nights and weekends. These dedicated students pursued undergraduate degrees in engineering while juggling their full-time jobs. Classes were scheduled from Monday to Friday, 6 pm - 10 pm, and on Saturdays from 9 am - 5 pm, spanning 16 weeks. Each term, I instructed two courses with approximately 30 students in each class. The program's unique challenge lay in accommodating the students' demanding schedules, and the evaluation methods included midterms, exams and bi-weekly assignments with carefully selected problems. This rigorous approach aimed to ensure students' success and learning while facing the challenges of a full-time job.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The courses that I taught at this institution are the following.
<br> ➢ Multivariate Calculus - Instructor
<br> ➢ Mathematical Logic -  Instructor
<br> ➢ Linear Algebra - Instructor
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I also was a suppoprting instructor providing independent tutorial sessions for reviewing lectures and problem-
solving to full-time students in the morning and afternoon programs in the following courses.
<br> ➢ Integral Calculus
<br> ➢ Differential Calculus
<br> The activities and participation on these tutorial sessions were 15% of the final grade.
</p>

<h3> Summer projects and Undergraduate dissertation </h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
During the Summer 2023, I worked with some of the students from my Abstract Algebra class from the Spring 2022 in applications of group theory to combinatorics problems. An extension of the connection between counting colored neckalces and Lyndown words was explored from a mathematical and computational prespective.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
In particular, one of the directions explored included the relationship of these combinatorial problems with Cohomology of certain polyhedral product actions. The project is serving as a dissertation project for one students aiming to graduate by Summer 2024.
</p>

<h3> Directed Reading Programs </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">
The directed reading program (DRP) is an educational initiative that allows students to engage in independent, guided study of advanced mathematical topics under the supervision and mentorship of a faculty member or graduate student. The primary goal of a DRP is to provide undergraduate students with the opportunity to explore mathematics beyond their regular coursework and develop their mathematical skills and understanding. I have participated in the following directed reading programs:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<b> Pares Ordenados Program - Spring 2023 </b>  <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/undergraduate/directed_reading_program.html" > (Website in Spanish) </a>. Pares Ordenados (ordered pairs in Spanish) it is a recently developed directed reading program targeted to foster mathematical learning to latin-american students that identify themselves as a minority. The program is run in an online format, conducted in Spanish, connecting undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in mathematics in the region with Faculty and graduate students across the world. My mentee was a student from Universidad del Valle, Colombia, intersted in learning algebraic topology. He faced challenges accessing to qualify faculty in their home university and the program was a fit for him. Topics such as the fundamental group, homotopy theory and homology where explored during the program and a project on the applications of algebraic topology tools into solving mathematical problems was developed. The project was selected in the poster session at the Colombian Congress of Mathematics in the same year.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
<b> University of Western Ontario DRP - Fall 2019 </b>  <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/undergraduate/directed_reading_program.html"> (Website) </a>. I had the opportunity to work with an  engineering student passionate about mathematics, yet unsure about pursing a math
major. My mentee and I worked on a geometrical approach to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem for surfaces in
the 3-dimensional space. The followed reference was Firby, Peter A., and Cyril F. Gardiner. Surface
topology. Elsevier, 2001. By the end of the term, my mentee was able to understand and explain the Euler
Characteristic and the proof of the index theorem using a geometrical approach; moreover, he decided to
completely dedicate to pursue his Major in mathematics after the program, ended up transferring to UBC next Fall. On Winter 2020 we continued working on a reading course in
Topological Manifolds following the classical book of Lie, extending the material from the DRP project.

## Other relevant Teaching and Training experience <a name="other"> </a>

<h3> Visiting Fellowship in Assessment in AP Precalculus</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In Fall 2023, I was invited by the AP Higher Education College Board (USA) to serve as a Visiting Faculty member. My role was to contribute valuable insights and feedback on the Advanced Placement (AP) Precalculus program. This collaborative effort aimed to ensure that the program maintains alignment with college-level courses while preserving the essential value of the AP Program for institutions and students. AP courses serve as a means for high-school students to engage with advanced coursework prior to college entry.
<br>
The high academic standards mantained by AP courses are reflected in their effectiveness in preparing students for success in subsequent college-level courses. This preparation often translates into students excelling in their college studies, with a higher likelihood of pursuing majors related to the respective AP subjects, particularly in the STEM field.
<br>
My contributions to the program involved revising its content and assessments, driven by my experience and the expectations I hold for undergraduate students enrolling at a Precalculus class in my institution. This collaborative effort between institutions, educators and the College Board ensures that the AP Precalculus program continues to provide students with a robust foundation for their academic journey, helping them excel in their higher education journey.
</p>

<h3> Training Teaching Assistants </h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    At the University of Rochester, I have had a trainer role for both undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants in the methodologies and practices of the department. This includes workshops on essential tasks such as navigating Webwork, Gradescope, and Blackboard, using their interfaces, customizing settings, uploading and grading student work, and sending emails, among other features. These workshops have not only benefitted teaching assistants but have also been valuable to colleagues within the department.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In 2019-2020 as a Senior graduate student, I was also tasked the supervision and training of recent graduate students in the use of the online grading systems used by the deparment: CrowdMark, GradeScope and WebWork.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I have authored comprehensive documentation on creating problems within Webwork, which includes companion files to facilitate problem creation within the platform. This documentation also covers the basics of the PERL programming language, which I self-learned while working with Webwork. This tutorial has proven to be a valuable resource for the mathematical community at various universities.
</p>


<h3> Recommendation Letters </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">
I am always delighted to provide recommendation letters for students who have interacted with me in various capacities, whether through coursework, teaching assistant roles, or collaborative reading projects. I have received requests from undergraduate students at all levels, seeking recommendations for purposes such as transferring schools, pursuing graduate studies, or applying for scholarships and internships.
</p>

<h3>Volunteering and Commmunity Service </h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
During 2015 I volunteered as instructor of conversational basic Spanish for students travelling to
Central and South America Spanish-speaking countries under the program <a href="http://cel.uwo.ca/students/impact/index.html">Impact Experience Program </a>
at Western. Students are part of projects that impacts a community abroad. Impact Experience offers all
students at Western and its affiliates access to unique co-curricular opportunities to support community
projects around the world.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I have also been a tutor for High-school and College students supporting their learning experience in most of the courses in Mathematics and Statistics. I provide my help both in-person or online to students around the world. I started the <em> MathForce </em> project; a group providing math support to students in the London, ON. community by connecting high-school students and graduate math students.

        <li> Prof Chaves is SUCH A GREAT PROFESSOR. Not only are his explanations clear and concise, the examples he provide in office hours help me understand so much. He is also extremely approachable outside of class. I'd definitely take a class with him again! </li>
<li>Professor Chaves is one of my favorite professors from my time at U of R. He has a great understanding of the material he teaches and provides that understanding in an approachable way for his students to understand. The material was challenging, but Prof. Chaves saw us through.</li>
<li>Professor Chaves was very well organized throughout the semester and made it easy to access and learn content through his lectures, zooms, and wellkept notes. Homeworks were well-designed to help guide students in learning and refining their Linear Algebra skills. He seemed to keep right on pace, if not ahead of schedule, for the class while still being sure to thoroughly cover each topi</li>
<li>He was willing to work with me outside of class multiple times each week to go over homework problems and other questions I had, and for that I will b
e forever grateful. He was always very accommodating with his office hours schedule, and I definitely would not have gotten through the course if I did n
ot have him as my instructor.</li>
        <li>Prof. Chaves is a great lecturer and I also appreciated how organized the posted notes were. In class, Prof. Chaves always made sure to have us answer
questions and he would explain anything we didn't understand. Prof. Chaves would also go over previous concepts to start the lecture, which made the
series unit much easier to understand</li>

## Peer Evaluations from Class Observations <a name="peer"> </a>

The following are comments from observer Graduate students attending one of my lectures during the Teaching Mentor Program (2019) at Western University.

<p style="text-align: justify">
    <em>
“Excellent usage of Audio-Visual aids to facilitate learning. Superior Enthusiasm displayed in delivering
the lecture content. Effective usage of whiteboard around the classroom. Higher comfort level
experienced between the attendees and the instructor leading to better understanding of the subject
content, distribution of worksheets that helped the attendees understand the subject better. Overall, you
practices an outstanding university teaching style and incorporates many teaching strategies that makes
        learning experience worthwhile.”</em>
    
Glen DSouza. Research Assistant. Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering. (2019).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
 <em>
“You had an astute ability to explain complex concepts to your audience by deconstructing big ideas into
smaller ones. When introducing the topic, you began by asking your students very simple questions, such
as “what is a polygon?” and subsequently asking students to identify the correct polygons out of a variety
of mixed shapes. This provided students with not only a clear definition but an opportunity to practice
applying their knowledge. You continuously utilized interactive exercises with the class with handouts and
gave the class adequate time to practice on their own. By taking up the worksheets after with the class,

# 5. Curriculum Development <a name="curriculum"> </a>

## Teaching Methods and style <a name="style"> </a>

<p>My lectures and teaching style are designed to provide a structured and engaging learning experience for students. Here's how my lectures typically unfold:</p>

<h3>Course Organization</h3>
<ul>
<li>I provide a clear course schedule with sections and suggested problems on the syllabus, ensuring that students have a roadmap for their learning journey. This organization promotes a sense of direction and purpose in the course.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before each lecture, I share reading notes with students. These notes give them an overview of what will be covered and highlight the learning outcomes of the day, allowing students to follow along more effectively. This pre-lecture preparation is like a compass, guiding students through the lecture content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology Integration</h3>
<ul>
<li>To accommodate remote students, I use tools like Zoom for live sessions and provide lecture recordings. I also use a microphone to ensure that everyone can hear me clearly. In the age of technology, this integration enables seamless access to knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Engagement and Interaction</h3>
<ul>
<li>I start each lecture by checking if students have any questions or need clarification on previous topics. This immediate interaction empowers students to voice their concerns and fosters a sense of inclusivity in the learning process.</li>
<li>Throughout the lecture, I incorporate concept-check questions to encourage student participation. I use technological tools like Poll Everywhere to make it easy for students to interact and provide their responses. This real-time engagement transforms passive listeners into active learners.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Balance Between Theory and Practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>My lectures are carefully balanced between theoretical concepts and practical applications. I engage students with active learning strategies and sprinkle in a bit of humor to keep the atmosphere lively and enjoyable. This balance not only equips students with knowledge but also the ability to apply that knowledge in real-world scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assessment and Follow-up</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the end of the lecture, I suggest concept-check questions to reinforce learning. I allocate some time for students to answer final questions and encourage them to follow up during office hours or reach out to the Teaching Assistant (TA) for further assistance. This assessment and follow-up ensure that students don't just learn in class but also retain and apply what they've learned.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resources for Reference</h3>
<ul>
<li>For students' convenience, I post clear lecture notes and recordings of the lecture for future reference. This ensures that they have access to the material whenever they need it. These resources are like a library of knowledge, available 24/7.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guiding the Learning Journey</h3>
<ul>
<li>During the lecture, my role as a professor is crucial. I serve as the navigator of the learning journey. I guide students through the curriculum, helping them connect the dots between different concepts. I provide context, explain complex ideas, and ensure that students grasp the material.</li>
<li>My real-time feedback and interaction with students offer them the opportunity to seek clarification, voice their concerns, and engage in discussions. This open dialogue fosters a dynamic learning environment where students actively participate in their education.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Facilitating Learning with Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>The integration of technology, including Zoom and Poll Everywhere, enhances the learning experience. It breaks down barriers between physical and virtual students, making education accessible to all. It also makes learning more engaging, as students can actively participate using their devices.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cultivating a Lifelong Learning Mindset</h3>
<ul>
<li>Through balanced lectures that blend theory and practice, I instill a lifelong learning mindset in students. They not only acquire knowledge but also the skills and confidence to keep learning beyond the classroom. They understand that education is not limited to a specific course but a continuous journey.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Empowering Students</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, my goal is to empower students. By providing clear organization, engaging lectures, and accessible resources, I enable students to take control of their education. I equip them with the knowledge and tools they need to succeed, both in the course and in their future endeavors.</li>
</ul>




## Teaching Innovations and Course Design <a name="coursedesign"> </a>




<p style="text-align: justify">
My stand on teaching innovation and course design revolves around flexibility, adaptability, and a student-centered approach. By carefully selecting materials, customizing content, diversifying assessment methods, leveraging technology, and maintaining a focus on the individual needs of each student, I aim to create a dynamic and effective learning environment that empowers students to reach their full potential while also providing accessible grading options to support their diverse learning journeys.
</p> 

<ol>
        <li><strong>Curated Learning Materials:</strong> I believe in choosing appropriate textbooks and secondary materials for each course. These resources should align with the course's objectives and the needs of the students. Furthermore, I am committed to providing open-source options whenever possible, making education more accessible and affordable. Additionally, I often share archive files from previous homework and exams to help students review and practice.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailored Learning Experiences:</strong> No two courses or audiences are the same. To ensure that each student's educational journey is as effective as possible, I focus on tailoring course objectives and content approaches to meet the unique needs of the audience. Getting to know the students prior to the semester is invaluable in this regard, allowing me to adapt my teaching methods and materials to maximize their learning outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Diverse Assessment Methods:</strong> To assess students' understanding and promote critical thinking, I incorporate various types of exam questions. This includes open-response questions, multiple-choice, true-false, and answer-given problems. Allowing students to bring a page of notes to certain assessments can aid in their comprehension, encouraging them to synthesize key concepts rather than rote memorization. </li>
<li><strong> Benefits of Oral-examinations:</strong> In small group classes, I have found that integrating one-on-one final examinations serves as an effective and valuable assessment method. These assessments not only evaluate a student's knowledge but also encourage active participation, thoughtful discussion, and foster a welcoming and accommodating learning environment. By engaging students individually, this approach enables personalized feedback, in-depth understanding of the subject matter, and the opportunity for students to express their thoughts and ideas with confidence. It also minimizes the risk of academic dishonesty and eases the stress associated with traditional written exams.
</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Technology:</strong> I recognize the importance of technology in the modern educational landscape. I actively use and encourage the integration of technology in my lectures and assignments. However, I also emphasize the balance between traditional teaching methods and technological tools. There are both benefits and drawbacks to relying heavily on technology, and I strive to find the optimal blend that enhances the learning experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessible Grading:</strong> I understand that students may have diverse starting points, and it's crucial to provide options for accessible grading. This can include different calculation methods for the final grade or allowing the option to drop certain homework scores. These strategies ensure that every student feels they have the possibility to excel, regardless of their initial performance.</li>
    </ol>


<p style="text-align: justify">
    I also have a proposed  Syllabus for a course in Transformation groups that I am looking forward to deliver for graduate students interested in my research areas. This proposed syllabus can be accessed in the Additional Files section.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
During most of my time as instructor and teaching assistant, I prepared independently problem sheets,
assignments and quizzes considering the topics covered in class and the most beneficial questions for the
students to prepare for their exams. In particular, I thrive for using technological tools into math teaching. I advocate for open source projects and the use of interactive blackboards when teaching mathematics.
</p>

## Online Teaching <a name="video"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">Online teaching has evolved into an integral component of modern education, catering to the needs of new generations. The technological advancements that provide accessibility and convenience should be embraced by educational institutions and educators. I firmly believe that students can derive immense benefits from a blend of traditional and online teaching methods, and I work for their continual improvement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">By relying on the power of digital tools such as Desmos, Geogebra, or Wolfram Alpha to illustrate concepts in calculus and linear algebra, or to demonstrate step-by-step problem-solving, students can perceive mathematics as a dynamic subject that evolves alongside humanity's progress. I always seek the opportunity to employ these tools to enrich the learning experience during my lectures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Moreover, it is essential to engage students actively in both in-person and online settings. Utilizing tools like Poll Everywhere, Gradescope, or Blackboard quizzes during class fosters interactive learning, allowing me to gauge students' understanding and address their queries in real time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Recognizing the diverse learning styles of students, I ensure accessibility by recording my lectures, making them available for reference at any time. Additionally, I provide clear, concise notes to facilitate independent study, offering comprehensive support for their academic journey.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Having taught both entirely online and blended courses, with over 200 YouTube videos, I have observed that online teaching holds distinct advantages in specific scenarios. However, I also acknowledge the profound legacy of the classical blackboard-and-chalk setup that has served education for centuries. I believe in promoting and preserving this time-tested method, especially when it remains a highly effective teaching approach, so I reserve this method to certain higher-level classes or topics.</p>

Some sample video lectures can be accessed through the Additional Files section of this Dossier.

## Technology use for Question Design <a name="questions"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
My mathematical question creation stance has been marked by a dedication to originality, the effective use of technology, the sharing of resources, and a commitment to improving mathematical education on both a local and national scale. I believe that the art of crafting questions is an integral part of helping students unlock the beauty and power of mathematics</p>

<p>In my commitment to developing quality mathematical questions, I adhere to the following principles:</p>

 <h3>Originality and Content Alignment</h3>
<p>I prioritize originality while ensuring that the questions align with the content delivered in lectures and assignments. This approach keeps the assessment relevant to the course material.</p>
<h3>Webwork and Randomization</h3>
<p>Webwork is my preferred platform for creating questions due to its ability to introduce layers of randomization and provide immediate feedback. This system enhances both homework and exam experiences, promoting deeper understanding and retention of the subject matter.</p>
<h3>Question Pool and Tutorial Documents</h3>
<p>I maintain an extensive pool of questions in Webwork, creating over 500 questions in various mathematical areas. These questions have led to the development of tutorial documents that have proven invaluable to fellow instructors interested in utilizing the system.</p>
<h3>Collaboration and Outreach</h3>
<p>I am dedicated to helping colleagues from other institutions adopt Webwork, guiding them through system installation and question creation. Notably, I supported the Colombian group "Lema" in their efforts to implement Webwork in the Spanish language.</p>
<h3>ICFES Mathematical Question Bank</h3>
<p>Additionally, I served as a designer and reviewer for the bank of mathematical questions at the Colombian Institute for the Assessment of Education (ICFES). This institution is responsible for developing standardized exams used for assessing students in Colombia. I contributed by creating innovative questions and evaluating previously created questions to ensure they met high standards of versatility, reliability, and validity, aligning with the rigorous requirements of the ICFES exams.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I am currently working on the joint use of WeBWork with other open source projects as <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/">GeoGebra</a>, <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, <a href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreText </a> and <a href="https://rederly.com/"> Rederly </a>. as well as fostering the use of these tools in Colombia by helping with demonstrating the use of the software and with their translations together with the <a href="https://www.grupolema.org/">Grupo Lema</a>. I am currently have a tutorial (both in English and Spanish) in progress on WeBWork question creation providing some templates and macros on how to effectively type new questions in WeBWork and integrating with other software. A preliminary version can be accessed <a href="https://schavesr.com/teaching/webwork.pdf"> here </a>.

## Reflection on Teaching Proofs in Mathematics <a name="selfreflection"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Teaching mathematical proofs for undergraduate students is a challenge for both instructors and students.
Proof is an essential part on learning as it develops reasoning skills, improves problem solving aptitudes
and it is also a fundamental basis for future researchers. This reflection is focused on studying the
difficulties experienced in the learning and teaching process of formal mathematical proofs, and discuss
whether the traditional "definition-theorem-example" lecture method is the most
appropriate for the students to success in mathematical courses.

# 7. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement <a name="dei"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Throughout my personal and professional experience, I recognize the importance of fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion within the academic community. As a first-generation college graduate, studying in a private-university under a full-scholarship, and pursuing a doctorate in a culturally diverse country yet still a visible minority, I understand the challenges faced by individuals from underrepresented socioeconomic, cultural, ethnic and academic backgrounds.
I have been dedicated to promoting diversity in education, STEM field and mathematics where all students should be given equal opportunities regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, abilities, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status or country of origin. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Mathematics, as served historically as a universal language, transcends the boundaries of personal backgrounds, and as a powerful means of
communication that unites ideas and promote knowledge. However, it is essential to acknowledge that
mathematics and other STEM fields have also been portrayed as careers predominantly tailored for men
and individuals perceived as exceptionally intelligent. My role in academia and the community is to foster
a perspective where Mathematics is seen as a welcoming, inclusive and diverse field accessible to anyone.
