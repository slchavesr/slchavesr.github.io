## Brief Biography <a name="briefbiography"></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
My teaching experience begins in 2011 as a Master’s student in Mathematics at the Universidad de los Andes where I was a teaching assistant for several first and second years courses. After I earned my Master’s degree in 2013, I had the opportunity to teach several introductory courses at the Universidad de Los Andes as well as other two universities in Bogotá, Colombia. These courses included Calculus, Algebra, Logic and Probability.  In 2015 I began my doctorate degree in Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario where I have been a teaching assistant for more than 10 different courses. I have also been actively involved in the development of the Directed Reading Program at the Department of Mathematics mentoring undergraduate students into interesting mathematical projects and help them to achieve their goals pursuing a major in this area. Finally, my background and diverse experience have help me to success  as a passionate teacher; as it is outlined in this Dossier, I enjoy teaching and look forward to developing my skills further as I pursue my academic career.

## Teaching Philosophy <a name="teachingphilosphy"></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
Throughout my career teaching mathematics, I have had the opportunity to work with a diverse class of students. I have been fortunate to interact with students within a huge range of ages, socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, and full-time/part-time status who have opened my eyes to the important role of the instructor in the learning process of each person. Even though any student's learning requires specific approaches, understanding the common problems and biases towards mathematics allows me to model my teaching style  in the most beneficial way for each audience and provide meaningful lectures and assessments for the students to succeed, not only during the course, but also to obtain an useful insight of mathematics for their particular interests. Therefore, I have realized that many students share a similar mindset about mathematics in general: Mathematics is a hard subject in nature, and it is only meant to geniuses or brilliant students. Mathematics is useless unless one wants to become a scientist and most of the things covered in the courses will not be used in “real life”.  Mathematics is uninteresting and boring, the more one study, the more abstract and deep mathematics turns itself,  and it is usually hard to relate the concepts to each others. Therefore, my teaching philosophy relies on fighting against these stereotypes; being aware of the world's need for  people who estimate, verify, support, interpret results and connect with other's ideas are the pillars that drive my career and have lead me to the teacher that I currently am.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
Firstly, I believe that Mathematics is a feasible subject that everyone is capable of achieving any level of understanding with the right guidance. I admit in front of my students that it might not be an easy subject, I share stories of my struggles as student and I make them feel that making mistakes is not wrong. I try to select problems carefully that leads student to fully analyze and appraise theorems and results discussed in lectures; always considering an accessible level for everyone in the course. Since I was a teaching assistant, I have gathered the most common mistakes made by students in the tests or assignments, I discussed with them where is the root of the problem, because there are even some voids from high-school or previous courses that need to be filled. I also tend to do a survey at the beginning of class to gather people's previous knowledge and expectations for the particular course; this survey can be presented also with a small problem set to keep track of those topics that need to be addressed beforehand. Once this information is collected, I suggested reading lectures and problems for people to keep up, and I devoted an extra teaching sessions or office hours to help as most students as I can for them to catch up. I support the idea that learning mathematics depends on student's opportunities, experiences and effort, and not in a innate intelligence. I am a fierce supporter of the premise that all students are capable of participating and achieving in mathematics, and every single one deserves support to reach to the highest levels.

<p style="text-align: justify"> 
Secondly, I work for presenting Mathematics as a useful subject. Even though many students will not compute an integral or apply the fundamental theorem of algebra on an instance of their future; I point out how mathematics enhances the ability to think rationally and to clearly organize ideas which leads to practical applications. I share my passion about Mathematics in the classroom, I show enthusiastically the endless implications and purposes of the particular theory that I have been teaching. I also refer to mathematical facts as artwork; and that in fact, mathematics is another form of art to appraise. I like to raise the analogy of this subject with other forms of art to my students: not all people like art paintings, sculptures or literature, but they do agree that this is some form of natural human expression; and Mathematics is not far from that premise; it is the natural language that the universe uses to manifest among us.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
Finally, I make of mathematics a lively and exciting subject. I base my teaching methods, style and tactics on encouraging students to adopt a growth mindset, to see mathematics as a subject of beauty and creativity in which anyone can thrive, where speed is not relevant, but depth is. I point out that the journey to an answer can be as important as the destination, and I adopt an approach where sense-making matters more than memorization. I make use of technological tools to help learner's experience, I discuss examples in class, showing problem-solving techniques, and making mistakes, getting stuck, and trying different strategies as normal steps in the process of learning. These combinations of the theoretical with the practical mindset, the traditional lectures with active-learning classroom strategies bring mathematics to light as a gratifying and pleasant subject among students.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
As a final point, I completely perceive teaching as a process that goes beyond the classroom; it is a whole compendium of one's preparation, experience, motivation and philosophy that reflects on student's mindset towards the subject, and each day I pursue an improvement on every aspect. I regard teaching as an essential stage of learning and forming character; and more than teaching the contents of a syllabus during a course, I establish on my teaching philosophy and methods the significance of the teaching-learning connection based on strengthening the process of reading, interpreting, applying and explaining on each student.  Even though some of the students will eventually forget the explicit contents of the course, I want to be a professor that prints a permanent mark on each student's professional and personal development, and one that they will always remember.
