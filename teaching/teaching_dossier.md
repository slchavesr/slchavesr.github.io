## Brief Biography <a name="briefbiography"></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
Teaching has always been a driving force behind my academic journey. After completing my Master's degree in Mathematics in 2013, I seized the opportunity to instruct introductory courses in Mathematics, which ignited my passion for teaching and inspired me to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario in 2015. Throughout my doctoral studies, I continued to expand my teaching experience by working as a teaching assistant for a diverse range of courses and actively contributing to the support of undergraduate while widening my teaching and professional portafolio. Since 2021, I've been a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester, where I've had the privilege of teaching a variety of courses, including higher level courses. My passion for teaching is evident throughout this dossier, and I am committed to fostering the learning process of my students as I continue to advance in my academic career.






</p>

## Teaching Philosophy <a name="teachingphilosphy"></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
"What is mathematics?" is a question I always begin my undergraduate first-day class with. While some students may hold positive perceptions of mathematics, biases, negative images, and misconceptions remain common among undergraduates. These misconceptions include beliefs such as "Mathematics is a hard, challenging, and boring subject", "It is solely about finding and using formulas", "It's just a required course for my program", or "It's only about solving problems."


</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
My teaching philosophy is rooted in raising awareness about the importance of mathematics, highlighting the valuable skills acquired through its study, and dispelling stereotypes and misconceptions. My approach centers on inspiring and motivating students to engage in activities such as estimation, verification, interpretation, articulation of results, and the ability to connect with others' ideas. These principles form the foundation of my teaching career. Moreover, sharing my passion for the subject and witnessing the transformation of students' answers to the question "What is mathematics?" into more positive perspectives has shaped me into the educator I am today.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
I view teaching as a comprehensive process that extends well beyond the confines of the classroom. It encompasses a spectrum of elements, including preparation, practical experience, motivation, and a guiding educational philosophy. These factors collectively shape a student's perspective on the subject matter, both within and outside the classroom. In my perspective, teaching represents a crucial phase in the journey of learning and character development, one that should be adapted to align with the current advantages and requirements of the contemporary world.

## Universidad Central de Colombia: Instructor (2013) <a name="ucentral"> </a>


<p style="text-align: justify">
    
During 2013 I served as an instructor at the <a href="https://www.ucentral.edu.co/"> Universidad Central de Colombia </a> in the department of
engineering and mathematics. My responsibilites were tailored  around working professionals studying during nights and weekends. These dedicated students pursued undergraduate degrees in engineering while juggling their full-time jobs. Classes were scheduled from Monday to Friday, 6 pm - 10 pm, and on Saturdays from 9 am - 5 pm, spanning 16 weeks. Each term, I instructed two courses with approximately 30 students in each class. The program's unique challenge lay in accommodating the students' demanding schedules, and the evaluation methods included midterms, exams and bi-weekly assignments with carefully selected problems. This rigorous approach aimed to ensure students' success and learning while facing the challenges of a full-time job.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
The courses that I taught at this institution are the following.
<br> ➢ Multivariate Calculus - Instructor
<br> ➢ Mathematical Logic -  Instructor
<br> ➢ Linear Algebra - Instructor
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I also was a suppoprting instructor providing independent tutorial sessions for reviewing lectures and problem-
solving to full-time students in the morning and afternoon programs in the following courses.
<br> ➢ Integral Calculus
<br> ➢ Differential Calculus
<br> The activities and participation on these tutorial sessions were 15% of the final grade.
</p>

## Mentoring Students <a name="mentor"> </a>


<p style="text-align: justify">
I participated in the <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/undergraduate/directed_reading_program.html"> Directed Reading Program at Western University </a>. The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students with graduate students/junior faculty to undertake
independent study projects. It is intended to help motivated students to explore topics more deeply than in
a classroom setting.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
The duration of the project was of one academic semester, which is roughly thirteen weeks. Undergraduates
can apply for DRP positions in the beginning of each term and those who are selected will be paired with
mentors according to their mathematical interests and availability. The projects are based around the self-
paced reading of a particular book or article with substantial guidance from the mentor, and the specific
topic arrives by discussion of common interests between the mentor and the mentee.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
My mentee was an engineering student passionate about mathematics, yet unsure about pursing a math
major. My mentee and I worked on a geometrical approach to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem for surfaces in
the 3-dimensional space. The followed reference was Firby, Peter A., and Cyril F. Gardiner. Surface
topology. Elsevier, 2001. By the end of the term, my mentee was able to understand and explain the Euler
Characteristic and the proof of the index theorem using a geometrical approach; moreover, he decided to
completely dedicate to pursue his Major in mathematics after the discussions, advises and suggestions that
I gave to him during our meetings. On Winter 2020 we continued working on a reading course in
Topological Manifolds following the classical book of Lie, extending the material from the DRP project.
</p>

## Other relevant Teaching experience <a name="other"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In 2019-2020 as a Senior graduate student, I was in charge of the supervision and training of recent graduate students in the use of the online grading systems used by the deparment: CrowdMark, GradeScope and WebWork.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
During the last years, I have been involved in online teaching, both collaborating in the department and enhancing personal goals. I have created videos, written solutions for textbook problems and providing help to students in online tutoring plataforms as <em> Numerade </em> and <em> OneClass</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
During 2015 I volunteered as instructor of conversational basic Spanish for students travelling to
Central and South America Spanish-speaking countries under the program <a href="http://cel.uwo.ca/students/impact/index.html">Impact Experience Program </a>
at Western. Students are part of projects that impacts a community abroad. Impact Experience offers all
students at Western and its affiliates access to unique co-curricular opportunities to support community
projects around the world.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I have also been a tutor for High-school and College students supporting their learning experience in most of the courses in Mathematics and Statistics. I provide my help both in-person or online to students around the world. I started the <em> MathForce </em> project; a group providing math support to students in the London, ON. community by connecting high-school students and graduate math students.

## Peer Evaluations from Class Observations <a name="peer"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    <em>
“Excellent usage of Audio-Visual aids to facilitate learning. Superior Enthusiasm displayed in delivering
the lecture content. Effective usage of whiteboard around the classroom. Higher comfort level
experienced between the attendees and the instructor leading to better understanding of the subject
content, distribution of worksheets that helped the attendees understand the subject better. Overall, you
practices an outstanding university teaching style and incorporates many teaching strategies that makes
        learning experience worthwhile.”</em>

<p style="text-align: justify">
 <em>
“You had an astute ability to explain complex concepts to your audience by deconstructing big ideas into
smaller ones. When introducing the topic, you began by asking your students very simple questions, such
as “what is a polygon?” and subsequently asking students to identify the correct polygons out of a variety
of mixed shapes. This provided students with not only a clear definition but an opportunity to practice
applying their knowledge. You continuously utilized interactive exercises with the class with handouts and
gave the class adequate time to practice on their own. By taking up the worksheets after with the class,
students were able to identify their own knowledge gaps and develop a clearer understanding of the
content.”

# Curriculum Development <a name="curriculum"> </a>

## Teaching Innovations and Course Design <a name="coursedesign"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I participated in the design of the the course Matrix Algebra and Linear Optimization at Universidad del
Rosario for the new program on Business and Marketing.
</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
    I also have a proposed <a href="https://schavesr.com/teaching/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> for a course in Transformation groups that I am looking forward to deliver for graduate students interested in my research areas.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
During most of my time as instructor and teaching assistant, I prepared independently problem sheets,
assignments and quizzes considering the topics covered in class and the most beneficial questions for the
students to prepare for their exams. In particular, I thrive for using technological tools into math teaching. I advocate for open source projects and the use of interactive blackboards when teaching mathematics.
</p>

## Lecture Videos Creation <a name="video"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In 2021, I created over 50 Lecture Videos for the course Mathematics 1225 (Methods of Calculus) at Western University to support the delivery of asynchronous Lectures for hundreds of students enrolled at this course.  A YouTube reproduction list with a sample of these videos can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKRwXr3FMlQZ4SPaBx0XWs4VPbMTuGrRv"> here </a>.
</p>


## Question Design and Technology Use <a name="questions"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I designed and created over 500 questions in WeBWork to support the delivery of the <em> Mathematical Structures </em> course at Western during 2020. I implemented the questions in several formats (multiple choice, true/false, etc) focusing in adding several layers of randomization to fight against academic offenses. I created questions for Logic, Set theory, Introductory number theory, combinatorics and Linear Algebra that might be added to the Open Problem Library in Webwork.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
I am currently working on the joint use of WeBWork with other open source projects as <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/">GeoGebra</a>, <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, <a href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreText </a> and <a href="https://rederly.com/"> Rederly </a>. as well as fostering the use of these tools in Colombia by helping with demonstrating the use of the software and with their translations together with the <a href="https://www.grupolema.org/">Grupo Lema</a>. I am currently have a tutorial (both in English and Spanish) in progress on WeBWork question creation providing some templates and macros on how to effectively type new questions in WeBWork and integrating with other software. A preliminary version can be accessed <a href="https://schavesr.com/teaching/webwork.pdf"> here </a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
During 2014 I worked as a designer and reviewer for the bank of mathematical questions at the Colombian
Institute for the Assessment of Education ICFES. This institution is the Colombian public entity in charge
of developing, implementing, facilitating and applying the standardized exams to students prior to
graduating from elementary, middle and high-school across the Country. The ICFES test (nowadays renamed to Saber-11) is nationally
recognized as the most important test in Colombia since it qualifies students according to their actual
academic skills and therefore it can affect the possibilities that a student might have to be accepted in
College.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I worked in the mathematical group for creating innovative questions and assessing questions created a
couple of years back by other instructors. Due to the nature of the exams, these questions must meet high
standards in terms of versatility, reliability and validity.
</p>

## Self-Reflection on Teaching Mathematics <a name="selfreflection"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Teaching mathematical proofs for undergraduate students is a challenge for both instructors and students.
Proof is an essential part on learning as it develops reasoning skills, improves problem solving aptitudes
and it is also a fundamental basis for future researchers. This reflection is focused on studying the
difficulties experienced in the learning and teaching process of formal mathematical proofs, and discuss
whether the traditional "definition-theorem-example" lecture method is the most
appropriate for the students to success in mathematical courses.
    <a href="https://schavesr.com/teaching/capstone.pdf"> This </a> is the complete reflection on this thinking done as requirement for my
professional development degrees.
