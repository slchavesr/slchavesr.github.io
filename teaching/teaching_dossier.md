## Brief Biography <a name="briefbiography"></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
My teaching experience begins in 2011 as a Master’s student in Mathematics at the Universidad de los Andes where I was a teaching assistant for several first and second years courses. After I earned my Master’s degree in 2013, I had the opportunity to teach several introductory courses at the Universidad de Los Andes as well as other two universities in Bogotá, Colombia. These courses included Calculus, Algebra, Logic and Probability.  In 2015 I began my doctorate degree in Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario where I have been a teaching assistant for more than 10 different courses. I have also been actively involved in the development of the Directed Reading Program at the Department of Mathematics mentoring undergraduate students into interesting mathematical projects and help them to achieve their goals pursuing a major in this area. Finally, my background and diverse experience have help me to success  as a passionate teacher; as it is outlined in this Dossier, I enjoy teaching and look forward to developing my skills further as I pursue my academic career.
