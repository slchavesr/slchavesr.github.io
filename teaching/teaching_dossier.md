## Brief Biography <a name="briefbiography"></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
My teaching experience begins in 2011 as a Master’s student in Mathematics at the Universidad de los Andes where I was a teaching assistant for several first and second years courses. After I earned my Master’s degree in 2013, I had the opportunity to teach several introductory courses at the Universidad de Los Andes as well as other two universities in Bogotá, Colombia. These courses included Calculus, Algebra, Logic and Probability.  In 2015 I began my doctorate degree in Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario where I have been a teaching assistant for several different courses. I have also been actively involved in the development of the Directed Reading Program at the Department of Mathematics mentoring undergraduate students into interesting mathematical projects and help them to achieve their goals pursuing a major in this area. Finally, my background and diverse experience have help me to success  as a passionate teacher; as it is outlined in this Dossier, I enjoy teaching and look forward to developing my skills further as I pursue my academic career.
</p>

## Teaching Philosophy <a name="teachingphilosphy"></a>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
Throughout my career teaching mathematics, I have had the opportunity to work with a diverse class of students. I have been fortunate to interact with students within a huge range of ages, socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, and full-time/part-time status who have opened my eyes to the important role of the instructor in the learning process of each person. Even though any student's learning requires specific approaches, understanding the common problems and biases towards mathematics allows me to model my teaching style  in the most beneficial way for each audience and provide meaningful lectures and assessments for the students to succeed, not only during the course, but also to obtain an useful insight of mathematics for their particular interests. Therefore, I have realized that many students share a similar mindset about mathematics in general: Mathematics is a hard subject in nature, and it is only meant to geniuses or brilliant students. Mathematics is useless unless one wants to become a scientist and most of the things covered in the courses will not be used in “real life”.  Mathematics is uninteresting and boring, the more one study, the more abstract and deep mathematics turns itself,  and it is usually hard to relate the concepts to each others. Therefore, my teaching philosophy relies on fighting against these stereotypes; being aware of the world's need for  people who estimate, verify, support, interpret results and connect with other's ideas are the pillars that drive my career and have lead me to the teacher that I currently am.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
    Firstly, I believe that <b> Mathematics is a feasible subject</b> that everyone is capable of achieving any level of understanding with the right guidance. I admit in front of my students that it might not be an easy subject, I share stories of my struggles as student and I make them feel that making mistakes is not wrong. I try to select problems carefully that leads student to fully analyze and appraise theorems and results discussed in lectures; always considering an accessible level for everyone in the course. Since I was a teaching assistant, I have gathered the most common mistakes made by students in the tests or assignments, I discussed with them where is the root of the problem, because there are even some voids from high-school or previous courses that need to be filled. I also tend to do a survey at the beginning of class to gather people's previous knowledge and expectations for the particular course; this survey can be presented also with a small problem set to keep track of those topics that need to be addressed beforehand. Once this information is collected, I suggested reading lectures and problems for people to keep up, and I devoted an extra teaching sessions or office hours to help as most students as I can for them to catch up. I support the idea that learning mathematics depends on student's opportunities, experiences and effort, and not in a innate intelligence. I am a fierce supporter of the premise that all students are capable of participating and achieving in mathematics, and every single one deserves support to reach to the highest levels.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
    Secondly, I work for presenting <b>Mathematics as a useful subject</b>. Even though many students will not compute an integral or apply the fundamental theorem of algebra on an instance of their future; I point out how mathematics enhances the ability to think rationally and to clearly organize ideas which leads to practical applications. I share my passion about Mathematics in the classroom, I show enthusiastically the endless implications and purposes of the particular theory that I have been teaching. I also refer to mathematical facts as artwork; and that in fact, mathematics is another form of art to appraise. I like to raise the analogy of this subject with other forms of art to my students: not all people like art paintings, sculptures or literature, but they do agree that this is some form of natural human expression; and Mathematics is not far from that premise; it is the natural language that the universe uses to manifest among us.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
    Finally, I make of <b>mathematics a lively and exciting subject</b>. I base my teaching methods, style and tactics on encouraging students to adopt a growth mindset, to see mathematics as a subject of beauty and creativity in which anyone can thrive, where speed is not relevant, but depth is. I point out that the journey to an answer can be as important as the destination, and I adopt an approach where sense-making matters more than memorization. I make use of technological tools to help learner's experience, I discuss examples in class, showing problem-solving techniques, and making mistakes, getting stuck, and trying different strategies as normal steps in the process of learning. These combinations of the theoretical with the practical mindset, the traditional lectures with active-learning classroom strategies bring mathematics to light as a gratifying and pleasant subject among students.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
As a final point, <em>I completely perceive teaching as a process that goes beyond the classroom; it is a whole compendium of one's preparation, experience, motivation and philosophy that reflects on student's mindset towards the subject,</em> and each day I pursue an improvement on every aspect. I regard teaching as an essential stage of learning and forming character; and more than teaching the contents of a syllabus during a course, I establish on my teaching philosophy and methods the significance of the teaching-learning connection based on strengthening the process of reading, interpreting, applying and explaining on each student.  Even though some of the students will eventually forget the explicit contents of the course, I want to be a professor that prints a permanent mark on each student's professional and personal development, and one that they will always remember.

## Universidad Central de Colombia: Instructor (2013) <a name="ucentral"> </a>


<p style="text-align: justify">
    
During 2013 I also served as an instructor at the <a href="https://www.ucentral.edu.co/"> Universidad Central de Colombia </a> in the department of
engineering and mathematics at that institution. I belonged to the roster of Instructors for the night-time

## Mentoring Students <a name="mentor"> </a>


<p style="text-align: justify">
I participated in the <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/undergraduate/directed_reading_program.html"> Directed Reading Program at Western University </a>. The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students with graduate students/junior faculty to undertake
independent study projects. It is intended to help motivated students to explore topics more deeply than in
a classroom setting.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
The duration of the project was of one academic semester, which is roughly thirteen weeks. Undergraduates
can apply for DRP positions in the beginning of each term and those who are selected will be paired with
mentors according to their mathematical interests and availability. The projects are based around the self-
paced reading of a particular book or article with substantial guidance from the mentor, and the specific
topic arrives by discussion of common interests between the mentor and the mentee.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
My mentee was an engineering student passionate about mathematics, yet unsure about pursing a math
major. My mentee and I worked on a geometrical approach to the Poincaré-Hopf theorem for surfaces in
the 3-dimensional space. The followed reference was Firby, Peter A., and Cyril F. Gardiner. Surface
topology. Elsevier, 2001. By the end of the term, my mentee was able to understand and explain the Euler
Characteristic and the proof of the index theorem using a geometrical approach; moreover, he decided to
completely dedicate to pursue his Major in mathematics after the discussions, advises and suggestions that
I gave to him during our meetings. On Winter 2020 we continued working on a reading course in
Topological Manifolds following the classical book of Lie, extending the material from the DRP project.

## Other relevant Teaching experience <a name="other"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
During 2015 I volunteered as instructor of conversational basic Spanish for students travelling to
Central and South America Spanish-speaking countries under the program <a href="http://cel.uwo.ca/students/impact/index.html">Impact Experience Program </a>
at Western. Students are part of projects that impacts a community abroad. Impact Experience offers all
students at Western and its affiliates access to unique co-curricular opportunities to support community
projects around the world.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I have also been a tutor for High-school and College students supporting their learning experience in most of the courses in Mathematics and Statistics. I provide my help both in-person or online to students around the world. I started the <em> MathForce </em> project; a group providing math support to students in the London, ON. community by connecting high-school students and graduate math students.

</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
This comments was sent by a students when working with them in regular one-to-one tutoring meetings.
 <em>
     <ul>
       <li> "Thank you so much! It was great working with you. I actually got 100 on my algebra last week, so I’m very happy about that. Thank you so much for the extra practice, I will definitely take a look at it since I have a math unit test this Saturday, and I’ll definitely reach out if I have any other questions or need extra help in the future". </li>

<p style="text-align: justify">
    <em>
“Excellent usage of Audio-Visual aids to facilitate learning. Superior Enthusiasm displayed in delivering
the lecture content. Effective usage of whiteboard around the classroom. Higher comfort level
experienced between the attendees and the instructor leading to better understanding of the subject
content, distribution of worksheets that helped the attendees understand the subject better. Overall, you
practices an outstanding university teaching style and incorporates many teaching strategies that makes
        learning experience worthwhile.”</em>

 <em>
“You had an astute ability to explain complex concepts to your audience by deconstructing big ideas into
smaller ones. When introducing the topic, you began by asking your students very simple questions, such
as “what is a polygon?” and subsequently asking students to identify the correct polygons out of a variety
of mixed shapes. This provided students with not only a clear definition but an opportunity to practice
applying their knowledge. You continuously utilized interactive exercises with the class with handouts and
gave the class adequate time to practice on their own. By taking up the worksheets after with the class,
students were able to identify their own knowledge gaps and develop a clearer understanding of the
content.”

# Curriculum Development <a name="curriculum"> </a>

## Teaching Innovations and Course Design <a name="coursedesign"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I participated in the design of the the course Matrix Algebra and Linear Optimization at Universidad del
Rosario for the new program on Business and Marketing.
</p> 
<p style="text-align: justify">
    I also have a proposed <a href="https://schavesr.com/teaching/syllabus.pdf"> Syllabus </a> for a course in Transformation groups that I am looking forward to deliver for graduate students interested in my research areas.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
During most of my time as instructor and teaching assistant, I prepared independently problem sheets,
assignments and quizzes considering the topics covered in class and the most beneficial questions for the
students to prepare for their exams. In particular, I thrive for using technological tools into math teaching. I advocate for open source projects and the use of interactive blackboards as BitPaper when teaching mathematics.
</p>

## Self-Reflection on Teaching Mathematics <a name="selfreflection"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Teaching mathematical proofs for undergraduate students is a challenge for both instructors and students.
Proof is an essential part on learning as it develops reasoning skills, improves problem solving aptitudes
and it is also a fundamental basis for future researchers. This reflection is focused on studying the
difficulties experienced in the learning and teaching process of formal mathematical proofs, and discuss
whether the traditional "definition-theorem-example" lecture method is the most
appropriate for the students to success in mathematical courses.
    <a href="https://schavesr.com/teaching/capstone.pdf"> This </a> is the complete reflection on this thinking done as requirement for my
professional development degrees.
</p>

## Question design <a name="questions"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I designed and created over 400 questions in WeBWork to support the delivery of the <em> Mathematical Structures </em> course at Western during 2020. I implemented the questions in several formats (multiple choice, true/false, etc) focusing in adding several layers of randomization to fight against academic offenses. I created questions for Logic, Set theory, Introductory number theory and combinatorics that might be added to the Open Problem Library in Webwork.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
During 2014 I worked as a designer and reviewer for the bank of mathematical questions at the Colombian
Institute for the Assessment of Education ICFES. This institution is the Colombian public entity in charge
of developing, implementing, facilitating and applying the standardized exams to students prior to
graduating from elementary, middle and high-school across the Country. The ICFES test (nowadays renamed to Saber-11) is nationally
recognized as the most important test in Colombia since it qualifies students according to their actual
academic skills and therefore it can affect the possibilities that a student might have to be accepted in
College.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I worked in the mathematical group for creating innovative questions and assessing questions created a
couple of years back by other instructors. Due to the nature of the exams, these questions must meet high
standards in terms of versatility, reliability and validity.
</p>


# Professional Development <a name="professional"> </a>

<p style="text-align: justify">
During 2019-2020 I pursued the  <a href="https://teaching.uwo.ca/programs/certificates/cutl.html"> Western Certificate in University Teaching  </a> to enhance my teaching career. It is
intended to improve teaching skills for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars at the University of
Western Ontario, and to prepare them for a future faculty or professional career. My certificate can be accessed <a href="https://schavesr.com/teaching/certificate.pdf"> here </a>
