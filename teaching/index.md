I am currently (**Spring 2024**) teaching and coordinating [MATH 162 / Engineering Calculus II](https://courses.math.rochester.edu/current/162/)  and [MATH 200WM / Transition to advanced Mathematics (w/ written module)](https://courses.math.rochester.edu/current/200/) at the University of Rochester.

## Previous courses taught at UofR

- Fall 2023: Precalculus and Linear Algebra w/ written module.
- Summer 2023: Discrete Mathematics (Online).
- Spring 2023: Discrete Mathematics and Abstract Algebra.
- Fall 2022: Discrete Mathematics and Linear Algebra w/ differential equations.
- Summer 2022: Calculus I (Online)
- Spring 2022: Engineering Calculus II  and Point-set Topology.
- Fall 2021: Calculus II and Linear Algebra w/ written module


## Former Teaching Experience

- During Fall 2023, I participated as an AP Calculus Visiting Fellow at the US College Board
- I was a Teaching Fellow supporting the implementation of [WeBWork](https://webwork.maa.org/) at Western, and authoring problems for Logic, Set Theory and Combinatorics.
- I was a supporting instructor for Methods of Calculus at Western University on Winter 2021. Some of the recorded asyncrhonous lecture notes are in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKRwXr3FMlQZ4SPaBx0XWs4VPbMTuGrRv).
- I am also interested in the development of open source tools for teaching Math. I am currently working on the joint use of [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), [WeBWork](https://webwork.maa.org/) and [PreTexT](https://pretextbook.org/).  

## Open source WeBWork Contributions

- Problems in Calculus, Linear Algebra, Logic, Set Theory and  Combinatorics.
- [WeBWork problem file generator](/resources/WWfilegenerator.md) A tool to create and download WeBWork problems breaking down the main contents of a WeBWork file.
- [WeBWork def problems downloader](/resources/downloader.py) A python script to download a set of problems from a .def file (generated by a WeBWork homework set).
- [WeBWork Problem Creation Tutorial](/webwork.pdf) A tutorial with companion template files to create the most common WeBWork problems.

## Teaching Development, Philosophy and Diversity Statement


- For previous courses that I have been involved with, refer to my [CV](https://slchavesr.github.io/Sergio%20Chaves%20-%20CV.pdf).
