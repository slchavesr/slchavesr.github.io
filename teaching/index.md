**Last Teaching Experience**

I am currently a Teaching Fellow supporting the implementation of [WeBWork](https://webwork.maa.org/) at Western, and authoring problems for Logic, Set Theory and Combinatorics.

I am also interested in the development of open source tools for teaching Math. I am currently working on the joint use of [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), [WeBWork](https://webwork.maa.org/) and [PreTexT](https://pretextbook.org/).  

I completed the [Western Certificate in University Teaching and Learning](https://teaching.uwo.ca/programs/certificates/cutl.html) on Feb 2020. 

For previous courses that I have been involved with, refer to my [CV](https://slchavesr.github.io/Sergio%20Chaves%20-%20CV.pdf).
