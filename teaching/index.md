## Last Teaching Experience

- I am currently a Teaching Fellow supporting the implementation of [WeBWork](https://webwork.maa.org/) at Western, and authoring problems for Logic, Set Theory and Combinatorics.

- I was a supporting instructor for Methods of Calculus at Western University on Winter 2021. Some of the recorded asyncrhonous lecture notes are in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKRwXr3FMlQZ4SPaBx0XWs4VPbMTuGrRv).

- I am also interested in the development of open source tools for teaching Math. I am currently working on the joint use of [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), [WeBWork](https://webwork.maa.org/) and [PreTexT](https://pretextbook.org/).  

## Open source WeBWork Contributions

- Problems in Linear Algebra, Logic, Set Theory and  Combinatorics.
- [WeBWork problem file generator](/resources/WWfilegenerator.md) A tool to create and download WeBWork problems breaking down the main contents of a WeBWork file.
- [WeBWork def problems downloader](/resources/downloader.py) A python script to download a set of problems from a .def file (generated by a WeBWork homework set).
- [WeBWork Problem Creation Tutorial](/webwork.pdf) A tutorial with companion template files to create the most common WeBWork problems.

## Teaching Development and Philosophy

- I completed the [Western Certificate in University Teaching and Learning](https://teaching.uwo.ca/programs/certificates/cutl.html) on Feb 2020. 

- For previous courses that I have been involved with, refer to my [CV](https://slchavesr.github.io/Sergio%20Chaves%20-%20CV.pdf).
