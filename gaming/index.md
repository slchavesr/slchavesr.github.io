Gaming has been one of my life-time passions. I have played videogames since I have memory, and I still do it up to this day! 

This site (still under construction) contains reviews, insights, discussions and gameplays of my hobby.

    Recommended Game! It is a puzzle game that also features a philosophical background about human moral and consciousness. While solving challenging and satisfying puzzles, the player is brought a series of questioning about what being human really means.
